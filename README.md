node-chatrooms
==============

Like the example Node.js chat application except it supports multiple rooms and
uses Socket.IO instead of long-polling. This is just a technical excercise.

TODO
----

* Name rooms
* Option to add a password to rooms when creating
* Actual authentication/logins
* Check compatibility with different browsers
* Add comments to code
* Add tests
* Room roles (Owner, moderator, user)
* Organize client code with Backbone.js
* Fix the error messages when picking a nickname
* Handle sessions better
* Fix socket.io problems with Chrome
* Update socket.io to development version
