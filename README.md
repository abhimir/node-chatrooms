node-chatrooms
==============

Just a technical exercise for me. I built a custom chat room based on the
node.js example and added the ability to have multiple rooms. Built using Express,
Jade, and Stylus.

TODO
----

* Name rooms
* Add passwords to rooms when creating
* Get it working with MongoDB using Mongoose
* Actual authentication
* Check compatibility with different browsers
* Add comments
* Add tests
* Look into Socket.IO integration
